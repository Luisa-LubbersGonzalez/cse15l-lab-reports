# *Lab Report #3*

## Part 1: Bugs
The bug I have chosen to explore from Week 4's lab is: 

## Part 2: Researching Commands
The command that I want to explore is `grep`.
- One of the commands that it has is `-i` which ignores case distinctions when matching patterns. Two examples where `-i` are used are: ![Image](-iExample1.png) This is one example of using this command 

- Another command used with `grep` is `-v` which prints out the lines that do not match the pattern we are searching for. Two examples of `-v` in use are: ![Image](-vExample2.png) 

- The command `-E` is used to treat patterns as extended regular expressions. Two examples of that in use are: ![Image](-Eexample1.png) This is one demonstration of how to use the command and how the lines that are given
Another example of using this command is ![Image](-Eexample2.png) This example demosntrates another usage of the command, with different parameters and a different output as a result of it. 

- A final command that I found interesting to use is `-C n` which is used when we want to print searched lines and a certain amount of lines after before the result. Examples of this command in use are: ![Image](-CnExample1.png) This specific example is an important demonstration of using this command because it demonstrates
The other example of using this command is ![Image](-CnExample2.png) This is another example of using the command, this time with different parameters, hence the different output.

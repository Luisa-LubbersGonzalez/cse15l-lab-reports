## Part 1: Bugs
The bug I have chosen to explore from Week 4's lab is: 

## Part 2: Researching Commands
The command that I want to explore is `grep`.
- One of the commands that it has is `-i` which ignores case distinctions when matching patterns. Two examples where `-i` are used are:

- Another command used with `grep` is `-v` which prints out the lines that do not match the pattern we are searching for. Two examples of `-v` in use are:

- The command `-E` is used to treat patterns as extended regular expressions. Two examples of that in use are:

- A final command that I found interesting to use is `-C n` which is used when we want to print searched lines and a certain amount of lines after before the result. Examples of this command in use are: ``` grep -i "doctor" *.txt ``` where the output was ``` 1471-2156-4-10.txt:        Cynthia Coffman is the post-doctoral associate who

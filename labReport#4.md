# *Lab Report #4*

## VIM Steps 4-9
For Step 4, the keys pressed were: ```ssh llubbersgonzalez@ieng6.ucsd.edu<ENTER>```
This was just me logging onto ieng6 to be able to complete the steps

For Step 5: the keys were: ```git clone <CMD> V<ENTER>```, ```rm -rf lab7<ENTER>```, ```<up><up><ENTER>```
I pasted the ssh link that I had gotten from my forked repository of Lab 7, then I had to delete the previouly clonned repo using `rm` because I had practiced the steps before. Then I just went up twice to access the `git clone` I had used before in my history
